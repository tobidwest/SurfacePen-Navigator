# SurfacePen-Navigator
A simple script that will allow you to use your surface pen to navigate through presentations made with software other than PowerPoint.

## About this script
- PowerPoint comes with a build-in functionality that allows you to navigate your slides in presentation mode by using your Surface Pen eraser button.
- This script allows you to navigate slides created with other software, such as a PDF document or Figma too which won't work out of the box.
- Press the eraser button once to navigate forward, press it twice to navigate backwards.

## How to set it up
- Install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/).
- Downlaod the file *SurfacePen-Navigator.ahk* from this repository and run it by double-clicking on it.
- If it doesn't work as expected: Open Windows settings, go to "Bluetooth and Devices" -> "Pen and Windows Ink". Make sure that default hotkey actions are set to "None" and "Allow apps to override the shortcut button behaviour" is toggled.

## How to modify the script
- What the script does is basically simulate the right key or left key on your keyboard being pressed when you hit the eraser button.
- Open the file in a code editor of your choice, e.g. Notpead that comes pre-installed on Windows machines.
- Drag and drop the file onto the editor window or right-click it and choose "Open with".
- Edit the code to fit your needs and run the script again.
